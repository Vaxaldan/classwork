What is programming?

Programming is like giving a computer instructions to do something</h3>

Imagine you're teaching a robot how to make a sandwich. You'd need to tell it step-by-step:

Get bread.
Put butter on bread.
Add cheese.
Put the top slice on.

Programming is like writing down those instructions in a language the computer can understand. This language is called a programming language.

Just like different people speak different languages, computers can understand different programming languages. Some popular ones include Python, JavaScript, and Java.
